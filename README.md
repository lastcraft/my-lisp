my-lisp
=======

Just how easy is it to write a Lisp really? You can inadvertantly leverage quit a few concepts when you write a Lisp in Lisp. I want to see where the real pain points are, so my-lisp is written in only standard C

Usage is just ./lisp
To quit use "(quit)" or "(exit)" with an optional exit code, e.g. (quit 3).

At the moment this is just a personal learning project and public domain.
